# Image-Recognition-DNN-and-Clustering
A DNN instance trained via transfer learning with the [VGG16 network](https://neurohive.io/en/popular-networks/vgg16/) that recognizes frailejón plants from an aereal view. We then run the outcome through k-means clustering and convex hull algorithms to calculate population density.
